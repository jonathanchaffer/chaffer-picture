Justification:
My code is neat and organized, styled correctly, and easy to read.
It contains Javadoc-style comments for all classes and methods, as
well as inline comments within longer methods to describe what 
certain portions of my code are doing. The code works as expected,
aside from a small hangup with the Spinner class in which it
does not always respond to mouse events such as shift-clicking,
dragging, and right-clicking (I think it has something to do with
the timer). Going in with almost zero prior experience with GUIs, 
I've definitely learned a lot. I've met all the requirements 
stated in the rubric, and in addition, I believe I have gone above
and beyond the minimum requirements, as I have used a timer in 
order to implement animation into the GUI. For these reasons, I 
believe I should get a 29/30 on this assignment.
